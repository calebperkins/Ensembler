        <Line>The most important one is trace: trace the dots as they TURN YELLOW (or as you see the ring around the circle start to shrink), NOT when you see them appear. A good trace will increase your score, while a bad trace will decrease your score.</Line>

        <Line>Consecutive incorrect moves will result in decrease of your baton's trail. At the same time, your screen will dim. When the length of trail reaches zero, you will have to try the level again.</Line>
