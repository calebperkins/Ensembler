        <Character>Game</Character>
        <Line>As for doing nothing... well, when you are not prompted to trace or shake, don't do anything.</Line>

        <Line>One last thing, the trail of shapes that follows your baton is also an indication on how well you are doing in the level.</Line>

        <Line>Consecutive incorrect moves will result in decreasing the number of shapes that follow your baton. When the number of stars reaches zero, you will have to try the level again.</Line>
