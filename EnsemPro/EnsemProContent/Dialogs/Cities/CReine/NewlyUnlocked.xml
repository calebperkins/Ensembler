        <Character>Bartender</Character>
        <Line>I'd say he is even better than the professionals out there. But let me tell you a secret... Violin is not his main instrument.

      <Item>
        <Character>Player</Character>
        <Line>Hey... your playing was great! And I don't say this to just anyone... My mother was a professional violinist, so I know it when I hear a good musician play.

      <Item>
        <Character>Player</Character>
        <Line>I want to become a conductor as well. I heard there is a conservatory in this city, so I thought I might recruit some players for my ensemble here.
        </Line>
      </Item>
      <Item>
        <Character>Frederic</Character>
        <Line>Indeed, and I happen to be one of the instructors of that conservatory.

        <Line>I have an idea. If you can impress me with your conducting, not only I will join your ensemble, but I will also urge my students to join.
