        <Line>I still remember, when I was a young girl, I lived by the sea...The gentle sea breeze, the crashing waves, the smooth sand...But what I miss the most are the creatures of the sea!I love watching fish swimming gracefully underwater, dolphins jumping merrily above the water, and the sea shells that just lay still on the sand...However, these wonderful memories are fading as I age,if only there is a way to help me reminisce my past, I can die without regrets.
